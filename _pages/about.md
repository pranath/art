<p>I have an inter-disciplinary background in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Somatic Studies & Contemporary Dance.</p>
  
<p>Some of the main themes that inflence my work are politics, psychology, science, climate change, economics, physics, philosophy, the nature of reality, human connection/disconnection, group dynamics, individualism, alienation and feeling.</p>
  
<p>Key tools i use for my work are generative image AI models such as Dall-E and others. I also recognise and acknowledge these AI models as not mere tools, but also co-creators of my work, and as very early forms of a new kind of intelligence who I collaberate with.</p>
